I found some code online to load each sprite in succession for one of the 3 paganitzu games.  From there I created PSPRITE, which is a sprite swapper.  Sprit-ed allows you to do pixel by pixel modifications.  It will also allows you to load 4 bit BMPs saved in paint and left click on the top of perspective sprites(which you can then modify at the pixel level).  Interestingly there's a file that lets you use the paganitzu script with the draw command in Qbasic too, which I took advantage of in junior high.
